# TODO: Planned features and functionalities

Not in any speciffic order, just for having a progress of what I'm doing.

- [ ]**All algorithms which accepts a variable output size (e.g. SHASUM, BLAKE2...)** Should have a
speciffic button visible only when this kind of algorithms are selected.

- [ ]**Change the donation button to be more discrete and less out-of-place**
- [ ]**Add all algorithms listed in [RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes)** 
- [ ]**Add a progress bar for file reading**
